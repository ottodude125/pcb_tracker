Greetings,

STD PCB Design uses the PCB Design Review Tracker to manage design reviews.

You will need the following information to log in.

	Username:	<%= @reviewer.login %>
	Password:	<%= @reviewer.passwd %>
	
When you first login with these credentials, you will be asked to change your
login information to your Teradyne Windows login so we can authenticate you 
against your Windows account information. While we ask for your password, this
is only to verify that the information you entered is correct. We do not store 
your Windows password. Using your Windows login means you have one less password
to remember. When your Windows password changes, you will need to use the new
password to log into the tracker. 

When a design is posted for review, you will receive an email from the tracker
indicating that a review has been posted.  The mail will have a link for you
to follow.

When you log in, the tracker will display a list of the boards that you are
responsible for reviewing.  When you click on the board number it will take
you to the review page.  From there you can follow links to see the design
data, attachments, and email list.  On the review page you can approve, waive,
reject, and add comments to record your review results.

Our intent was to create an intuitive tool.  Please provide feedback, positive
or negative.  If you encounter any problems with the tracker, please file a
Design Support Request using Design Support Request tool DSR Track
(http://boarddev.teradyne.com/DSR_Track/projects/pcb-design-tracker/issues/new). 


The tracker is located at <%= Pcbtr::PCBTR_BASE_URL %>tracker
